Team project: Creating a simple shell
Team: Mukadi Shilumba

This is a team project for the ALX Software Engineering program. The goal of this project is to create a simple UNIX command language interpreter that reads commands from either a file or standard input and executes them. This is the second team project in the program.

The simple shell can be invoked both interactively and non-interactively. If invoked with standard input not connected to a terminal, it reads and executes received commands in order. If invoked with standard input connected to a terminal, an interactive shell is opened. When executing interactively, the shell displays the prompt $ when it is ready to read a command. Alternatively, if command line arguments are supplied upon invocation, the shell treats the first argument as a file from which to read commands.
